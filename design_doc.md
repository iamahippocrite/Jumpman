# This is the Design Doc for the Game **Jumpman**.
This is a platformer game in the style of Mario .
Here are some of the objectives that i want to cover
1. Main character should be able to run in 2 directions and Jump (DONE)
2. There should be a few floating platforms that the MC can jump up to and stand on.
3. There must be a few enemies throughout the level that the MC can Stomp on.
4. At least one level should be made and it should be sidescrolling or have a few screens that the character can travel across
5. A Menu screen that looks seperate from the game.
6. Highscore that is saved and should be displayed at the end.
